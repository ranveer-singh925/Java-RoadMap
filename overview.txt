Second commitL-



 what is spring security?
 type we have?
    Basic Authentication:- in which a sample pop is open instead of a form based.
                            no logout was possible
                            it is also compatible with postman and browser.
                            This way of authentication was mostly used but not recommended because we have more way to authencate the user.
                            in which we have a default user and auto generated password.
